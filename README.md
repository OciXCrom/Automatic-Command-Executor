# Automatic-Command-Executor
This plugin allows you to add specific commands in a .ini file. The commands will be used on the player that you choose when he joins the server. This is useful when organizing tournaments in which the winner gets a specific reward that need to be given to him when he is in the server, for example deathrun points. Not all plugins use additional files for these kind of stuff, so instead of waiting for the player to join the server and an administrator to be online, simply add the player's name, SteamID or IP address and the command in the .ini file. The plugin can also be used as a server protection against particular players.
